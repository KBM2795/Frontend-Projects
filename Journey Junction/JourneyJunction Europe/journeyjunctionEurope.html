                <p class="europe-info-p">With its layers of history and overlapping of cultures, Europe is a treasure
                    trove of everything from the medieval and ancient to the baroque and art nouveau. Couple this with
                    Arctic conditions in the north and beautiful Mediterranean climates in the south, and there’s a
                    whole side of nature to go with the main dish of culture that can be found in this wonderful
                    continent. <br><br>
                    Sinking cities, leaning towers, and mystic old towns are mixed with Catholic churches, deep lochs,
                    and sweeping fjords. This hotbed of history and civilization makes for an undeniably exciting place
                    for any traveler to explore, so here are the top tourist attractions in Europe to help you plan your
                    next trip. <br>

                    <h3 class="all-h3">1.Colosseum</h3>
                    <p class="all-p">The Colosseum is the perfect symbol of the power of the Roman Empire at its height.
                        Dating back to 72 AD, it was designed to hold 50,000 spectators and was, at the time, the
                        biggest amphitheater ever built. Here, all manner of public spectacles were shown – from animal
                        hunts and executions to gory gladiator battles; it was even filled with water for mock sea
                        battles.<br><br>
                        Although practically a ruin, the Colosseum is still very much an icon of Rome. Step inside the
                        arches and take a tour of the structure. Sit and imagine yourself as a spectator in Roman times,
                        and the grand displays and spectacles that went on inside the ring

                    <p class="all-p">The Acropolis in Athens is a simply stunning sight. This monumental hill is the location of a number of ancient sites that date back to the 5th century BC. Some of the attractions that crown the Acropolis include the Temple of Athena Nike, the Erechtheion, and, of course, the Parthenon.<br><br>
                        Constructed at the peak of the Athenian Empire in 447 BC, the Parthenon is a symbol of Greece and impresses with its innumerable columns. Dedicated to Athena, it became a Christian church in the 6th century AD and a mosque in the 1460s after the Ottoman invasion. After nightfall, the Acropolis is lit up with a glow that can be seen around Athens.

                    <h3 class="all-h3">3.Hagia Sophia</h3>
                    <p class="all-p">For almost 1,000 years, Hagia Sophia was the biggest cathedral in the world and is still a fantastic structure to set eyes on. Originally built as an Eastern Orthodox Cathedral in 537 AD when Istanbul was named Constantinople, Hagia Sophia became an Ottoman mosque from 1453 and is today a museum for all faiths to enjoy.<br><br>
                        The dome of the Hagia Sophia is a marvel in itself, and the building as a whole perfectly reflective of Byzantine architecture – as well as Istanbul’s patchwork heritage. Walking around the building today, you can piece together the history of the city with its intriguing murals and interesting artifacts.

                    <p class="all-p">Built on the ruins of Roman fortifications in 889 AD, Alhambra is a combination palace and fortress situated in Granada, Spain. For almost 1,000 years, much of the Iberian peninsula was ruled by the Islamic Moors, with Andalusia (the area where Alhambra is located) being their longest-held territory.<br><br>
                        Today, you can explore its citadel, the oldest part of the fortress, climb up its watchtower, explore the amazing Moorish gardens and courtyards, and be amazed at the delicate geometric patterns throughout the complex. The setting on the backdrop of the Sierra Nevada makes Alhambra that much more mystical.

                    <p class="all-p">One of the top reasons many people travel to Norway is to see its majestic fjords. Shaped by glaciers over an incomprehensibly long 2.5 million years or so, the towering U-shaped valleys and their carved cliffs create a stunning landscape that’s almost too huge to take in.<br><br>
                        Norway boasts over 1000 fjords, only a portion of which are visited en masse (like the Hardangerfjord and Geirangerfjord), meaning it’s still possible to find a slice of solitude. Taking a cruise ship is a great way to see the soaring walls of the fjords as the boat glides on the waters. Alternatively, hiking atop the fjords offers a birds-eye-view of the incredible landscape.
